About Me   
</h3>
<p>
    I am a high school teacher working in the Los Angeles area. I teach Film and Television Production and Digital Photography classes. I am originally from Wyoming, where I studied Theater and English at the University of Wyoming. Then I attended Boston University for graduate school. I earned an MFA in Film Production. Then I got a job at Disney Interactive Media. I worked with players online as a game master for Pirates of the Caribbean Online and World of Cars games. 
    <br/> I completed my teaching credential in English, and soon I moved on to teach Drama for a couple of years. I then returned to the video game industry. I worked at Riot Games where I had my first experience in training and development. I am currently working toward an Educational Specialist degree in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri.
