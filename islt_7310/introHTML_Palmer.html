    Hello everyone! My name is Stacey Palmer. I am currently a high school teacher living and working in the Los Angeles area, but I am originally from a very small town in Wyoming. I teach Film and TV Production and Digital Photography. This is my second semester at the University of Missouri. I am working toward an EdSp degree in Learning Technologies and Design. I do not have any experience or training in web application or development, so I am expecting to learn a lot in this course. I think it is good to have a basic understanding of web development, and I would like to be able to work on my own website. I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and traveling. I also really like writing young adult fiction when I have extra time, which is not often. I hope to someday work in educational video game design.
